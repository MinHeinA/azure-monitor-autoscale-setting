- `capacity` - (Required) A capacity block as defined below.
  - `default` - (Required) The number of instances that are available for scaling if metrics are not available for evaluation. The default is only used if the current instance count is lower than the default. Valid values are between 0 and 1000.
  - `maximum` - (Required) The maximum number of instances for this resource. Valid values are between 0 and 1000.
  - `minimum` - (Required) The minimum number of instances for this resource. Valid values are between 0 and 1000.

  - `metric_trigger` - (Required) A metric_trigger block as defined below.
    - `metric_name` - (Required) The name of the metric that defines what the rule monitors, such as Percentage CPU for Virtual Machine Scale Sets and CpuPercentage for App Service Plan.
    - `metric_resource_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Resource which the Rule monitors.
    - `operator` - (Required) Specifies the operator used to compare the metric data and threshold. Possible values are: Equals, NotEquals, GreaterThan, GreaterThanOrEqual, LessThan, LessThanOrEqual.
    - `statistic` - (Required) Specifies how the metrics from multiple instances are combined. Possible values are Average, Max, Min and Sum.

    - `time_grain` - (Required) Specifies the granularity of metrics that the rule monitors, which must be one of the pre-defined values returned from the metric definitions for the metric. This value must be between 1 minute and 12 hours an be formatted as an ISO 8601 string.
    - `time_window` - (Required) Specifies the time range for which data is collected, which must be greater than the delay in metric collection (which varies from resource to resource). This value must be between 5 minutes and 12 hours and be formatted as an ISO 8601 string.
    - `threshold` - (Required) Specifies the threshold of the metric that triggers the scale action.
    - `metric_namespace` - (Optional) The namespace of the metric that defines what the rule monitors, such as microsoft.compute/virtualmachinescalesets for Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
    - `dimensions` - (Optional) One or more dimensions block as defined below.
      - `name` - (Required) The name of the dimension.
      - `operator` - (Required) The dimension operator. Possible values are Equals and NotEquals. Equals means being equal to any of the values. NotEquals means being not equal to any of the values.
      - `values` - (Required) A list of dimension values.

  - `scale_action` - (Required) A scale_action block as defined below.
    - `cooldown` - (Required) The amount of time to wait since the last scaling action before this action occurs. Must be between 1 minute and 1 week and formatted as a ISO 8601 string.
    - `direction` - (Required) The scale direction. Possible values are Increase and Decrease.

  - `end` - (Required) Specifies the end date for the profile, formatted as an RFC3339 date string.
  - `start` - (Required) Specifies the start date for the profile, formatted as an RFC3339 date string.
  - `timezone` - (Optional) The Time Zone of the start and end times. Defaults to UTC.
