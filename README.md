# terraform-azure-monitor-autoscale-setting

This module encapsulates azurerm\_monitor\_autoscale\_setting where it can be used for autoscaling configuration for VMSS, App Services and other scalable resources.

The examples in this module are adapted from virtual machine scale set AVM module: https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-avm-res-compute-virtualmachinescaleset.
